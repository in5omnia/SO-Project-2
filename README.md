## Operating Systems Project - Delivery 2
with [@powy-e](https://www.github.com/powy-e)

Using the base code given, we built a simple message publishing and subscription system, where messages are stored in the TecnicoFS file system. The system has an autonomous server process to which different client processes can connect to publish or receive messages in a given message storage box.
